# Comfy INT8 Acceleration

This node speeds up Flux2, Chroma, Z-Image, Ernie Image in ComfyUI by using INT8 quantization, delivering between 1.5~2x faster inference on my 3090 depending on the model. It should work on any NVIDIA GPU with enough INT8 TOPS. It appears to be faster than FP8 on 40-Series and above as well. 
Works with lora, torch compile.

Updates:

2026-15-05:

Bringing back stochastic lora. Some loras appear to need it, others don't, try it if your lora is not working and you don't like pre-lora.

Attempt at reducing RAM usage

Fixed an issue with Pre-Lora crashing on windows

2026-10-05:

Overhauled the entire lora system. Normal lora loader node works now, no need for specialized lora loaders.

Converted QuaRot to ConvRot, which is a small but free quality gain.

Added Pre-Lora node, which you can connect to the INT8 Model loader to merge loras before utilizing on the fly quantization. 

For more info on quality of convrot, lora approaches see the [Metrics](Metrics.md)

---

Pre-quantized checkpoints were recommended for most architectures, but on-the-fly quantization with ConvRot is better in all cases.
However, ConvRot is also a little slower, so these prequantized models are still useful. Avoid using INT8 Tensorwise models.

¹Z-Image Base weights have been Deprecated in favor of Convrot OTF, which is higher quality.

²Tensorwise models are worse than on the fly quantization since we switched to row-wise INT8

I would also like to point out that we beat Nunchaku INT4 on every quality measurement in the [Quality Metrics](Metrics.md)

Additionally, the quality of loras applied with [this nunchaku lora node](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-QwenImageLoraLoader) appears to be degraded.

# Requirements:
Working ComfyKitchen (needs latest comfy and possibly pytorch with cu130)

Triton

Windows untested, but I hear triton-windows exists.

If you have a 30-Series GPU, OneTrainer is also the fastest current lora trainer thanks to this. Please go check them out!!
